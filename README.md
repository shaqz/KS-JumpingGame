# Jumping-Game
This is a basic jumping game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by the T-Rex game found in Google Chrome. The game provides a simple yet entertaining experience where the player controls a character who must jump over obstacles to score points.

## How to Play

* Avoid colliding with the obstacles by timing your jumps carefully.
* The game ends when the character collides with an obstacle.
